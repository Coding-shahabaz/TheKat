# Light Bulb Switch Web App

## Overview

This project is a simple **Light Bulb Switch Web App** that allows users to toggle a light bulb on and off using two buttons. The application is built using **HTML**, **CSS**, **Bootstrap**, and **JavaScript**. It also includes dynamic interaction with images to make the experience more engaging. 

### Key Features:
- **Toggle Light Bulb:** The user can switch the bulb on and off using two buttons.
- **Dynamic Image Switching:** When the light is off, a cat image with glowing eyes appears, adding a fun effect to the switch action.
- **Switchboard Design:** A simple, visually appealing switchboard interface built with **Bootstrap**.
- **Status Display:** The current status of the light ("Switched On" or "Switched Off") is shown dynamically on the page.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: For creating the structure of the web page.
- **CSS3**: For styling the web page and images.
- **Bootstrap**: To ensure a responsive and well-structured layout.
- **JavaScript**: For adding the interactive functionality of switching images and buttons.
  
## How it Works
1. **Light Bulb and Cat Image**: The application displays two images: a light bulb and a cat. When the switch is toggled:
    - The light bulb image changes based on the status (on or off).
    - The cat image also changes; glowing cat eyes appear when the light is off.
  
2. **Switch Buttons**: Two buttons, "ON" and "OFF," are provided:
    - When the **ON** button is clicked, the light bulb image changes to an "on" state and the cat image reverts to a normal state.
    - When the **OFF** button is clicked, the light bulb turns off, and the cat's eyes glow in the dark.
